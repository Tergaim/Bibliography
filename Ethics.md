#### 2020 - Raghavan et al. - [Mitigating Bias in Algorithmic Hiring: Evaluating Claims and Practices](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.09208)

Document and analyze the claims and practices of companies offering algorithms for employment assessment.
In particular, they identify vendors of algorithmic pre-employment assessments (i.e., algorithms to screen candidates), document what they have disclosed about their development and validation procedures, and evaluate their practices, focusing particularly on efforts to detect and mitigate bias.
The analysis considers both technical and legal perspectives.
