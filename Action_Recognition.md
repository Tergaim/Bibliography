# Action Recognition

#### 2020 - Obinata and Yamamoto - [Temporal Extension Module fo Skeleton-Based Action Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08951) 

Action recognition based on Graph Convolutional Network, using temporal graph of the skeleton. Usually, a joint is connected to the neighbouring joint in the same frame, and to the same joint in frame n+-1.
In this work, information about neighbouring joints in frames n+-1 is also used. They show that not only is this method efficient, but it can be applied to improve other GCN-based methods' accuracy.
